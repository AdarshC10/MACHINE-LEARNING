# 🤖 Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of end-to-end **Machine Learning projects** implemented using Python.  
The projects are organized into two main categories: **Classification** and **Regression**, showcasing both predictive modeling techniques.

---



## 🔍 Project Categories

### 🧪 Classification Projects
Classification models are used to predict **discrete categories / labels**.

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Diabetes | Predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on medical attributes |
| Heart Disease Prediction | Predicts the presence of heart disease using clinical data |
| Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction | Classifies whether sonar signals detect a rock or a mine |
| Titanic Prediction | Predicts survival of passengers on the Titanic dataset |

---

### 📈 Regression Projects
Regression models are used to predict **continuous numerical values**.

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Boston | Predicts house prices in Boston suburbs |
| Big Mart Sales Prediction | Forecasts sales of retail items across different outlets |
| California House Prediction | Predicts property prices using California housing dataset |
| Gold Price Prediction | Predicts future gold prices using historical market data |
| Medical Insurance Cost Prediction | Estimates insurance premiums based on personal and medical attributes |
